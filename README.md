<h1>LED Controller</h1>

This is a LED controller PCB design exercise that allows for precise control of LED brightness and color with the following features:

1. üí° Allows for the regulation of LED brightness.
2. üé® Allows for the choice of color if it's an RGB LED.
3. üîå Accepts a supply voltage of 100-240V AC.
4. üîã Has 12V DC / 5A and 24V DC / 2.5A outputs.
5. üì∂ Has WiFi and Bluetooth communication by ESP32 Microcontroller.
6. ‚è∞ Has a built-in clock for timed lighting.
7. ‚ôªÔ∏è Allows for energy-efficient LED usage.

<h1>Usage</h1>

To use the LED controller, follow these steps:

1. Connect the LED controller to a power source using a 100-240V AC power supply.
2. Connect the LED(s) to the LED controller.
3. Set the desired brightness and color using the controller's interface.
4. Use the built-in clock to turn the LED(s) on and off at specific times.
