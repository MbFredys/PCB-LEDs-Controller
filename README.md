This is a LED controller PCB design exercise that allows for precise control of LED brightness and color with the following features:

1. 💡 Allows for the regulation of LED brightness.
2. 🎨 Allows for the choice of color if it's an RGB LED.
3. 🔌 Accepts a supply voltage of 100-240V AC.
4. 🔋 Has 12V DC / 5A and 24V DC / 2.5A outputs.
5. 📶 Has WiFi and Bluetooth communication by ESP32 Microcontroller.
6. ⏰ Has a built-in clock for timed lighting.
7. ♻️ Allows for energy-efficient LED usage.

<h1>Usage</h1>

To use the LED controller, follow these steps:

1. Connect the LED controller to a power source using a 100-240V AC power supply.
2. Connect the LED(s) to the LED controller.
3. Set the desired brightness and color using the controller's interface.
4. Use the built-in clock to turn the LED(s) on and off at specific times.
